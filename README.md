# Clean Architecture - POC

This is a Proof of Concept about Clean Architecture, using new ways to apply the Uncle Bob taught. Always that we start a new project in a professional environment, the developers' team have long discussions about how to struct in an easy way the concepts of Clean Architecture. Then this project aims to give a visual solution about how to organize the packages and folders, implementing a general idea of a parking lot application.
